Remember Barbara
it was raining ceaselessly on Brest that day
and you were walking smiling
beaming delighted dripping
under the rain.
Remember Barbara
it was raining ceaselessly on Brest
and I passed you in the rue de Siam. 
You were smiling
and me I was smiling the same smile.
Remember Barbara
you who I didn’t know
you who didn’t know me
Remember
Remember that day anyway
don’t forget
a man was taking shelter under an overhang
and he yelled your name
Barbara
and you ran to him under the rain
dripping delighted beaming
and you threw yourself in his arms.
